IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. [OK] COMPLETE: Dataset structure and quality verified
2. NEXT: Aggregate transaction-level > flight-level data
   - Sum SALES and LOST SALES per FLIGHT KEY
   - Create binary targets: shortage_occurred (0/1)
3. NEXT: Implement feature engineering pipeline
   - All 58+ features listed above
4. NEXT: Train XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Network
5. NEXT: Evaluate and compare models

KEY METRIC TO TRACK:
>> Can we reduce stockout rate from {summary['stockout_rate_percent']:.1f}% to <5%?
